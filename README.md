# EDR Project

## Objective

This project focuses on implementing an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution using Aurora Lite and Velociraptor. The goal is to monitor endpoint activity, detect potential threats, and respond to incidents effectively. This project highlights the deployment, configuration, and use of these tools in a simulated environment to showcase real-world cybersecurity practices.

### Skills Learned

- Learned how to deploy and configure Aurora Lite to monitor endpoint activities such as process creation, file access, and network connections.
- Understood how to capture, log, and analyze endpoint events to identify potential security incidents.
- Understood how to develop and execute response strategies when a threat is detected, including isolating compromised endpoints, killing malicious processes, and collecting additional data for investigation.
- Gained insights into normal endpoint behaviors and how to detect deviations that could signal security issues.
- Gained experience in safely simulating threats on endpoints to test and improve the detection and response capabilities of your EDR solution.
- Gained insights into normal endpoint behaviors and how to detect deviations that could signal security issues.

### Tools Used
